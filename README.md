Leasing calculator can be found from https://www.lhv.ee/en/leasing#calculator

The requirements to follow for testing can be found from https://www.lhv.ee/en/leasing#price-list

Rules for test cases:

• You’ll have to test the leasing monthly instalment calculator;

• Both manual and automated tests should be created. How many tests are necessary and
enough, is up to you;

• Provide short argumentation on what criteria your tests were based on and why you created
exactly this set of tests;

• You can choose how you test manually– it’s important to understand what the test stories are
about and what is tested with certain test cases.

• Framework for test automation can be chosen freely. E.g. Selenide (http://selenide.org/) can
be used. We want to understand how you manage tests on the code level. Record/playback
applications (e.g. Selenium IDE) are not allowed to use.
