# Introduction

I gave an example of creating tests using the Cypress framework. For me, this is the first experience of interaction, and this
can confirm that this tool is easy to use. Part of the tests I wrote checks the display, calculation
and the full cycle of creating an application. Since I was a little limited in time, the number of test cases here
is not definitive, but it can show where I would start if I got a similar task in real work.

The requirements to follow for testing can be found from https://www.lhv.ee/en/leasing#price-list

**Rules for test cases:**

• You’ll have to test the leasing monthly instalment calculator;

• Both manual and automated tests should be created. How many tests are necessary and
enough, is up to you;

• Provide short argumentation on what criteria your tests were based on and why you created
exactly this set of tests;

• You can choose how you test manually– it’s important to understand what the test stories are
about and what is tested with certain test cases.

• Framework for test automation can be chosen freely. E.g. Selenide (http://selenide.org/) can
be used. We want to understand how you manage tests on the code level. Record/playback
applications (e.g. Selenium IDE) are not allowed to use.


# How to run tests
For run test-cases, you need to use command `npm run cy:open`
